  I apply individual synthetic control (Vagni and Breen, 2021) on survey data from the ELIPSS panel (https://www.sciencespo.fr/cdsp/en/projects/ongoing-projects/the-elipss-panel/) to estimate the causal effect of job loss on opinion and trust into institutions. Individual Synthetic Control (ISC) stem from the the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) first developped by Abadie and al. and widely use in the policy evaluation litterature. Unline SCM, ISC hypothesize the possibility to measure individual causal effects.
