  I apply individual synthetic control (Vagni and Breen, 2021) on survey data from the ELIPSS panel (https://www.sciencespo.fr/cdsp/en/projects/ongoing-projects/the-elipss-panel/) to estimate the causal effect of job loss on opinion and trust into institutions. Individual Synthetic Control (ISC) stem from the the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) first developped by Abadie and al. and widely used in the policy evaluation litterature. Unlike SCM, ISC hypothesize the possibility to measure individual causal effects. Such an approach is recent and goes against the idea that “causal effects cannot be observed or directly calculated at the individual level” (Morgan and Winship, 2014). This dissertation aims to test this claim and provide insight into the formation of opinion by using an innovative method.
